# arduino-1.6.8-Prusa
Modified Arduino IDE meant for Prusa Rambo board for compiling the HEX files


## Prusa Mod

This branch contains the file modifications and deletions required to compile, flash and export the Prusa modified marlin firmware.


## "Installation" not really

Don't forget to run the ardunio_builder.exe file after you first downlaod and unzip the files / clone and pull this branch.

Arduino.exe may not run otherwise.

## Compiling firmware with multiple Arduino versions installed

Be sure to open this version of the arduino IDE first before going in the program and opening the marlin.ino file.

Additionally make sure you're using the RAMBo board to compile your code.
